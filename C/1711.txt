       <p><em>These terms apply to non-enterprise customers. They also apply to enterprise customers who licensed GitHub offerings prior to January 4, 2021. Enterprise customers who purchase GitHub offerings after that date are directed to <a href="https://www.github.com/enterprise-legal">https://www.github.com/enterprise-legal</a> for current terms.</em></p> 
       <h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h2> 
       <p>The parties agree that the GitHub Data Protection Agreement (Non-Enterprise Customers) (<strong>“DPA”</strong>) sets forth their obligations with respect to the processing of Customer Personal Data in connection with the GitHub Enterprise Cloud hosted service (the <strong>“Service”</strong>). GitHub makes the commitments in this DPA to all non-enterprise customers using the Service. Separate terms, including different privacy terms, govern Customer’s use of non-GitHub products.</p> 
       <p>In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the DPA and any other terms in Customer’s agreements with GitHub, the DPA shall prevail. The provisions of the DPA supersede any conflicting provisions of the GitHub Privacy Statement that otherwise may apply to processing of Customer Personal Data as defined herein. For clarity, consistent with Clause 10 of the Standard Contractual Clauses in Attachment 1, the Standard Contractual Clauses prevail over any other terms in the DPA.</p> 
       <h2 id="github-data-protection"><a href="#github-data-protection">GITHUB DATA PROTECTION</a></h2> 
       <h3 id="1--definitions"><a href="#1--definitions">1. Definitions.</a></h3> 
       <p>1.1 The "<strong>Applicable Data Protection Laws</strong>" means certain laws, regulations, regulatory frameworks, or other legislations relating to the processing and use of Customer Personal Data, as applicable to Customer's use of GitHub and the GitHub Service, including:</p> 
       <p> a. The EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (<strong>"GDPR"</strong>), along with any implementing or corresponding equivalent national laws or regulations, once in effect and applicable; and</p> 
       <p> b. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civ. Code §§1798.100 et seq. (<strong>"CCPA"</strong>); and</p> 
       <p> c. The UK Data Protection Act 2018 and implementation of GDPR contained therein.</p> 
       <p>1.2 "<strong>Controller</strong>," "<strong>Data Subject</strong>," "<strong>Member State</strong>," "<strong>Personal Data</strong>," "<strong>Personal Data Breach</strong>," "<strong>Processing</strong>," "<strong>Processor</strong>," and "<strong>Supervisory Authority</strong>" have the meanings given to them in the Applicable Data Protection Laws. In the event of a conflict, the meanings given in the GDPR will supersede.</p> 
       <p>1.3 "<strong>Customer Personal Data</strong>" means any Personal Data for which Customer is a Controller, whether supplied by Customer for processing by GitHub or generated by GitHub in the course of performing its obligations under the Agreement. It includes data such as billing information, IP addresses, corporate email addresses, and any other Personal Data for which Customer is a Controller.</p> 
       <p>1.4 "<strong>Customer Repository Data</strong>" means any data or information that is uploaded or created by Customer into any of its Private Repositories.</p> 
       <p>1.5 A "<strong>Data Breach</strong>" means a Personal Data Breach or any other confirmed or reasonably suspected breach of Customer's Protected Data.</p> 
       <p>1.6 "<strong>End User</strong>" means an individual Data Subject who controls a GitHub account and has agreed to the GitHub Terms of Service, and whose Personal Data is being transferred, stored, or processed by GitHub. For example, each Customer employee or contractor who has a GitHub account is also a GitHub End User.</p> 
       <p>1.7 "<strong>Permitted Purposes</strong>" for data processing are those limited and specific purposes of providing the Service as set forth in the Agreement, the GitHub Privacy Statement, and this Exhibit A, or the purposes for which a Data Subject has authorized the use of Customer Personal Data.</p> 
       <p>1.8 "<strong>Protected Data</strong>" includes any Customer Personal Data and any Customer Repository Data processed by GitHub on behalf of Customer under the Agreement.</p> 
       <p>1.9 "<strong>Sensitive Data</strong>" means any Customer Personal Data revealing racial or ethnic origin; political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership; processing of genetic data or biometric data for the purposes of uniquely identifying a natural person; data concerning health, a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation; and data relating to offences, criminal convictions, or security measures.</p>

       <h4 id="21-data-processing"><a href="#21-data-processing">2.1 Data Processing.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub acts as a Processor in regard to any Customer Personal Data it receives in connection with the Agreement, and GitHub will process Customer Personal Data only for Permitted Purposes in accordance with Customer's instructions as represented by the Agreement and other written communications. In the event that GitHub is unable to comply with Customer's instructions, such as due to conflicts with the Applicable Data Protection Laws, or where processing is required by the Applicable Data Protection Laws or other legal requirements, GitHub will notify Customer to the extent permissible. GitHub processes all Customer Personal Data in the United States or in the European Union; however, GitHub's subprocessors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. Additionally, GitHub acts as a Processor for any Customer Repository Data.</p> 
       <h4 id="22-data-controllers"><a href="#22-data-controllers">2.2 Data Controllers.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub receives Customer Personal Data both from Customer and directly from Data Subjects who create End User accounts. Customer is a Controller only for the Customer Personal Data it transfers directly to GitHub.</p> 
       <h4 id="23-github-compliance-data-transfers"><a href="#23-github-compliance-data-transfers">2.3 GitHub Compliance; Data Transfers.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub will comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws in relation to the processing of Customer Personal Data.</p> 
       <p>All transfers of Customer Personal Data out of the European Union, European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland to provide the Service shall be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses in Attachment 1 (Standard Contractual Clauses). GitHub will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and other processing of Customer Personal Data from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland. All transfers of Customer Personal Data to a third country or an international organization will be subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR and such transfers and safeguards will be documented according to Article 30(2) of the GDPR.</p> 
       <p>In addition, GitHub is certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and the commitments they entail, although GitHub does not rely on them as a legal basis for transfers of Personal Data. GitHub agrees to notify Customer if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principles.</p> 
       <h3 id="3-data-protection"><a href="#3-data-protection">3. Data Protection.</a></h3> 
       <h4 id="31-purpose-limitation"><a href="#31-purpose-limitation">3.1 Purpose Limitation.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub will process and communicate the Protected Data only for Permitted Purposes, unless the Parties agree in writing to an expanded purpose.</p> 
       <h4 id="32-data-quality-and-proportionality"><a href="#32-data-quality-and-proportionality">3.2 Data Quality and Proportionality.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub will keep the Customer Personal Data accurate and up to date, or enable Customer to do so. GitHub will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that any Protected Data it collects on Customer's behalf is adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is transferred and processed. In no event will GitHub intentionally collect Sensitive Data on Customer's behalf. Customer agrees that the GitHub Service is not intended for the storage of Sensitive Data; if Customer chooses to upload Sensitive Data to the Service, Customer must comply with Article 9 of the GDPR, or equivalent provisions in the Applicable Data Protection Laws.</p> 
       <h4 id="33-data-retention-and-deletion"><a href="#33-data-retention-and-deletion">3.3 Data Retention and Deletion.</a></h4> 
       <p>Upon Customer's reasonable request, unless prohibited by law, GitHub will return, destroy, or deidentify all Customer Personal Data and related data at all locations where it is stored after it is no longer needed for the Permitted Purposes within thirty days of request. GitHub may retain Customer Personal Data and related data to the extent required by the Applicable Data Protection Laws, and only to the extent and for such period as required by the Applicable Data Protection Laws, provided that GitHub will ensure that Customer Personal Data is processed only as necessary for the purpose specified in the Applicable Data Protection Laws and no other purpose, and Customer Personal Data remains protected by the Applicable Data Protection Laws.</p> 
       <h4 id="34-data-processing"><a href="#34-data-processing">3.4 Data Processing.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub provides the following information, required by Article 28(3) of the GDPR, regarding its processing of Customer's Protected Data:</p>

       <h4 id="41-technical-and-organizational-security-measures"><a href="#41-technical-and-organizational-security-measures">4.1 Technical and Organizational Security Measures.</a></h4> 
       <p>Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, GitHub will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the Protected Data. GitHub will regularly monitor compliance with these measures and will continue to take appropriate safeguards throughout the duration of the Agreement. </p>

       <h4 id="44-records"><a href="#44-records">4.4 Records.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub will maintain complete, accurate, and up to date written records of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of Customer containing the information required under the Applicable Data Protection Laws. To the extent that assistance does not risk the security of GitHub or the privacy rights of individual Data Subjects, GitHub will make these records available to Customer on request as reasonably required, such as to help Customer demonstrate its compliance under the Applicable Data Protection Laws. </p> 
       <h4 id="45-assistance"><a href="#45-assistance">4.5 Assistance.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub will provide reasonable assistance to Customer with concerns such as data privacy impact assessments, Data Subject rights requests, consultations with Supervisory Authorities, and other similar matters, in each case solely in relation to the processing of Customer Personal Data and taking into account the nature of processing.</p> 
       <h3 id="5-use-and-disclosure-of-protected-data"><a href="#5-use-and-disclosure-of-protected-data">5. Use and Disclosure of Protected Data.</a></h3> 
       <h4 id="51-no-use-in-marketing"><a href="#51-no-use-in-marketing">5.1 No Use in Marketing.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub will not use the Protected Data for the purposes of advertising third-party content, and will not sell the Protected Data to any third party except as part of a merger or acquisition.</p> 
       <h4 id="52-github-privacy-statement"><a href="#52-github-privacy-statement">5.2 GitHub Privacy Statement.</a></h4> 
       <p>The GitHub Privacy Statement, publicly available at <a href="/en/articles/github-privacy-statement">https://docs.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement</a>, provides detailed notice of GitHub's privacy and data use practices, including its use of cookies, its dispute resolution process, and further details about GitHub's GDPR compliance.</p>

       <h4 id="61-protection-of-data"><a href="#61-protection-of-data">6.1 Protection of Data.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub is liable for onward transfers of Protected Data to its subprocessors, such as its third-party payment processor. In the event that GitHub does transfer the Protected Data to a third-party subprocessor, or GitHub installs, uses, or enables a third party or third-party services to process the Protected Data on GitHub's behalf, GitHub will ensure that the third-party subprocessor is bound by written agreement that requires them to provide at least the same level of confidentiality, security, and privacy protection as is required of GitHub by this DPA and the Applicable Data Protection Laws.</p> 
       <h4 id="62-acceptance-of-github-subprocessors"><a href="#62-acceptance-of-github-subprocessors">6.2 Acceptance of GitHub Subprocessors.</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer authorizes GitHub to appoint (and permit each subprocessor appointed in accordance with this Section 6 to appoint) subprocessors in accordance with Section 6 and any other restrictions in the Agreement. GitHub may continue to use those subprocessors currently engaged as of the Effective Date of this Addendum.</p> 
       <h4 id="63-general-consent-for-onward-subprocessing"><a href="#63-general-consent-for-onward-subprocessing">6.3 General Consent for Onward Subprocessing.</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer provides a general consent for GitHub to engage onward subprocessors, conditional on GitHub's compliance with the following requirements:</p> 
       <p>a. Any onward subprocessor must agree in writing to only process data in a country that the European Commission has declared to have an "adequate" level of protection; or to only process data on terms equivalent to the Standard Contractual Clauses, or pursuant to a Binding Corporate Rules approval granted by competent European data protection authorities, or pursuant to compliant and valid EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certifications; and</p> 
       <p>b. GitHub will restrict the onward subprocessor's access to Customer Personal Data only to what is strictly necessary to perform its services, and GitHub will prohibit the subprocessor from processing the Customer Personal Data for any other purpose.</p> 
       <h4 id="64-disclosure-of-subprocessor-agreements"><a href="#64-disclosure-of-subprocessor-agreements">6.4 Disclosure of Subprocessor Agreements.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub maintains a list of onward subprocessors it has engaged to process Customer Personal Data at <a href="/en/articles/github-subprocessors-and-cookies">https://docs.github.com/articles/github-subprocessors-and-cookies</a>, including the categories of Customer Personal Data processed, a description of the type of processing the subprocessor performs, and the location of its processing. GitHub will, upon Customer's written request, provide Customer with this list of subprocessors and the terms under which they process the Customer Personal Data. Pursuant to subprocessor confidentiality restrictions, GitHub may remove any confidential or commercially sensitive information before providing the list and the terms to Customer. In the event that GitHub cannot disclose confidential or sensitive information to Customer, the Parties agree that GitHub will provide all information it reasonably can in connection with its subprocessing agreements.</p> 
       <h4 id="65-objection-to-subprocessors"><a href="#65-objection-to-subprocessors">6.5 Objection to Subprocessors.</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub will provide thirty (30) days' prior written notice of the addition or removal of any subprocessor, including the categories listed in Section 6.4, by announcing changes on its <a href="https://github.com/github/site-policy">https://github.com/github/site-policy</a> site. If Customer has a reasonable objection to GitHub's engagement of a new subprocessor, Customer must notify GitHub promptly in writing. Where possible, GitHub will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an alternative solution to the affected Service to avoid processing of data by the objectionable subprocessor. In the event that GitHub is unable to provide an alternative solution and the Parties cannot resolve the conflict within ninety days, Customer may terminate the Agreement.</p> 
       <h3 id="7-termination"><a href="#7-termination">7. Termination.</a></h3> 
       <h4 id="71-suspension"><a href="#71-suspension">7.1 Suspension.</a></h4> 
       <p>In the event that GitHub is in breach of its obligations to maintain an adequate level of security or privacy protection, Customer may temporarily suspend the transfer of all Customer Personal Data or prohibit collection and processing of Customer Personal Data on Customer's behalf until the breach is repaired or the Agreement is terminated.</p> 
       <h4 id="72-termination-with-cause"><a href="#72-termination-with-cause">7.2 Termination with Cause.</a></h4> 
       <p>In addition to any termination rights Customer has under the Agreement, Customer may terminate the Agreement without prejudice to any other claims at law or in equity in the event that:</p> 
       <p>a. GitHub notifies Customer that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations;</p> 
       <p>b. the transfer, collection, or processing of all Customer Personal Data has been temporarily suspended for longer than one month pursuant to Section 7.1;</p> 
       <p>c. GitHub is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or representations under this Addendum;</p> 
       <p>d. GitHub is no longer carrying on business, is dissolved, enters receivership, or a winding up order is made on behalf of GitHub; or</p>

       <h2 id="attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors"><a href="#attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors">Attachment 1 – The Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors)</a></h2> 
       <p>Execution of the applicable agreement by Customer includes execution of this Attachment 1 to the GitHub Data Protection Addendum, which is countersigned by GitHub, Inc.</p> 
       <p>In countries where regulatory approval is required for use of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses cannot be relied upon under European Commission 2010/87/EU (of February 2010) to legitimize export of data from the country, unless Customer has the required regulatory approval.</p> 
       <p>For the purposes of Article 46(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, Customer (as data exporter) and GitHub (as data importer, whose signature appears below), each a “party,” together “the parties,” have agreed on the following Contractual Clauses (the “Clauses” or “Standard Contractual Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.</p> 
       <h4 id="clause-1-definitions"><a href="#clause-1-definitions">Clause 1: Definitions</a></h4> 
       <p>(a) 'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing', 'controller', 'processor', 'data subject' and 'supervisory authority' shall have the same meaning as in the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;</p> 
       <p>(b) 'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data;</p>
