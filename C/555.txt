         <p>We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.</p> 
         <p>Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.</p> 
         <p>If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/online-privacy-notice.go?request_locale=en_US#advertising-on-our-sites" target="_blank">opt out of online behavioral advertising</a>. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.</p> 
         <p>Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.</p>

            Zelle in our mobile app is a fast, safe way to send and receive money with friends, family, and businesses you trust no matter where they bank in the U.S. -- with no fees in our app. 
           <p>Here's how to use it.</p> 
           <p>Sign in to our app and tap Transfer | Zelle.</p> 
           <p>If it's your first time using Zelle, tap Setup.</p> 
           <p>Follow the prompts to enroll, which include adding your U.S. mobile number or email that others can use to send you money.</p> 
           <p>Say you want to send $20 to Tim for yesterdays lunch.</p> 
           <p>In Transfer | Zelle tap Send.<br><br>Enter Tims contact information or select Tim from your contact list.</p> 
           <p>Enter the amount, select the account, and tap Continue.</p> 
           <p>Verify Tims information is correct, then tap Send.</p> 
           <p>If hes already enrolled with Zelle, Tim will get a text or email saying you sent him money, and the funds will go directly to his bank account.<br><br>If hes new to Zelle, the text or email will include a link with instructions on how to receive his money.</p> 
           <p>You can also request money, like rent from your roommates, or to split expenses for that weekend trip.</p> 
           <p>Keep in mind, with Zelle your money moves from your bank account to someone else's in minutes.</p> 
           <p>So it's important you know and trust who you are sending money to and never use it with others who you don't know, or to pay for goods and services you have not yet received.</p> 
           <p>So next time you need to send or receive money, just open your Bank of America app and tap Transfer | Zelle.</p>

           Hello 
          <br>
          <br> My name is Holly ONeill, and I am responsible for Client Care at Bank of America. 
          <br>
          <br> Our highest priority right now is the health and well-being of those we care about. 
          <br>
          <br> This includes the many steps we are taking to ensure our financial centers are safe for our team and for you. 
          <br>
          <br> Of course, we have many ways you can take care of your financial needs without ever leaving home, through online or on your phone. 
          <br>
          <br> More than 39.1 million people actively use our Online Banking services. 
          <br>
          <br> And more than 29.8 million clients use our Mobile Banking services, including our award winning mobile assistant, called Erica. 
          <br>
          <br> Through Mobile Banking, 
          <br>
          <br> You can check balances, transfer funds, make payments, and set up alerts that work for you and your priorities. &nbsp; 
          <br>
          <br> If you need financial assistance, you can also request a deferral of a payment  for example on your mortgage, credit card or auto loan with Bank of America. 
          <br>
          <br> Mobile Banking will also be helpful for our clients in the upcoming weeks, as Economic Impact Payments begin to arrive to eligible Americans from the U.S. Government. 
          <br>
          <br> This process will continue for several weeks. 
          <br>
          <br> Some people will receive the payment through direct deposit, and some will receive a paper check in the mail. 
          <br>
          <br> For information about who is eligible, and how payments will happen  visit the IRS website. It includes information and answers to common questions, at www.irs.gov. 
          <br>
          <br> For your account, and questions you may have for us  we recommend you take these steps: 
          <br>
          <br> Make sure you have our Mobile Banking app on your phone. 
          <br>
          <br> Take a look at how you can deposit your check just by opening the app, clicking where it says Deposit Checks, and following a few easy steps.&nbsp;You will receive confirmation of the deposit quickly and securely. 
          <br>
          <br> Check out all you can do on the app, including setting up direct deposit or low balance alerts, and using our digital assistant, Erica. 
          <br>
          <br> There will be no fees for depositing your Economic Impact Payment check through Mobile Banking. 
          <br>
          <br> You can also check your balance, or deposit a paper check, at our ATMs. 
          <br>
          <br> To find an ATM that accepts deposits  find an open Financial Center  or learn more about how were taking action  use the tools in Mobile Banking, or online at www.bankofamerica.com. 
          <br>
          <br> We continue to listen closely to your feedback. My team monitors every transaction, every call  and we will continue to respond with updates like this one. 
          <br>
          <br> Thank you for being our client, and please be safe.

        <h2><b>Eligible clients can apply now for PPP loan forgiveness</b></h2> 
        <p>Our PPP loan forgiveness portal is now open and includes a simplified forgiveness application for PPP loans of $150,000 or less. We will email clients with a link to access our loan forgiveness application over the coming weeks, when the application becomes available to them. For more details on how to apply, visit our&nbsp;<u><a href="https://about.bankofamerica.com/promo/assistance/latest-updates-from-bank-of-america-coronavirus/ppp-forgiveness" target="_blank">PPP loan forgiveness site</a></u>.</p> 
        <p>Please note:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>We will continue to process loan forgiveness applications for clients who previously submitted completed applications with all supporting documentation. Clients who wish to withdraw and apply using the simplified application process should notify us immediately. Once we submit a clients application to the SBA, the client may be unable to withdraw it.<br> <br> </li> 
         <li>Clients who previously withdrew their application for loan forgiveness, or whose application was canceled due to incomplete documentation, are welcome to start a new application</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>As a reminder:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>You have until the maturity date of your loan to apply for forgiveness, as long as you have an outstanding balance on your PPP loan. This guidance applies regardless of the terms in your PPP Promissory Note.<br> <br> </li> 
         <li>You do not need to apply for loan forgiveness on your first PPP loan in order to be eligible for a second draw PPP loan. For details on eligibility and requirements for second draw PPP loans, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank"><u>SBA website</u></a>.</li>
