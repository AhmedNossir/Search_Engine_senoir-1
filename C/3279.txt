     <p>There may be a time when you’ll feel “too old” for web development. When you begin to feel that, here are a few thoughts. They might not be all you need but—maybe they are of&nbsp;use. </p>

     <h3><a href="/en/blog/valid-html-2021/">2% of the Top 100 U.S. Websites Use Valid HTML (in&nbsp;2021)</a></h3> 
     <p>Is frontend development in the bad shape it’s said to be? Is it hyperbole when frontend developers are accused of poor quality work? When you look at the code of the most popular websites, the answer is&nbsp;clear. </p>

     <h3><a href="/en/blog/upgrade-your-html-3/">Upgrade Your HTML&nbsp;III</a></h3> 
     <p>If you care about HTML as a craft, if you consider yourself an HTML minimalist, if you believe in pushing for boundaries (and sometimes overdoing it), then this is <em>a</em> right book (and a right book series) for you—with 10 fresh examples from the field that get inspected and&nbsp;improved. </p>

     <h3><a href="/en/blog/code-in-quarantine/">Code in&nbsp;Quarantine</a></h3> 
     <p>In the current paradigm, we often work with components and have a 1:1 relationship of HTML to CSS. This makes maintenance more predictable. However, it also pronounces the problem of rarely used code—which can be useful to put in&nbsp;quarantine. </p>

     <h3><a href="/en/blog/critical-frontend-development/">In Critical Defense of Frontend&nbsp;Development</a></h3> 
     <p>The field of frontend development is in another crisis, largely due to an incomplete, misinterpreted definition and a bizarre mess created by “web development as a commodity” and “web development as software development.” How frontend development is more than development, and what we can (and should)&nbsp;do. </p>

     <h3><a href="/en/blog/ignore-amp/">Ignore&nbsp;AMP</a></h3> 
     <p>In 2018, my recommendation was to avoid AMP, to use AMP for the most relevant pages, or to use AMP only. In 2020 my recommendation is to ignore it, because AMP largely appears meaningless now. <cite>Upgrade Your HTML II</cite> gives an opinionated idea&nbsp;why. </p>

     <p>According to our data, the classic idea of making sure websites and apps work without JavaScript being enabled is dead; when we look only at support requirements, this was the end of the story. It’s not, however, when we employ a broader look at JavaScript and its&nbsp;misuses. </p>
