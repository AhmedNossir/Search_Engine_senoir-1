     <p>Is frontend development in the bad shape it’s said to be? Is it hyperbole when frontend developers are accused of poor quality work? When you look at the code of the most popular websites, the answer is&nbsp;clear. </p>

     <h3><a href="/en/blog/upgrade-your-html-3/">Upgrade Your HTML&nbsp;III</a></h3> 
     <p>If you care about HTML as a craft, if you consider yourself an HTML minimalist, if you believe in pushing for boundaries (and sometimes overdoing it), then this is <em>a</em> right book (and a right book series) for you—with 10 fresh examples from the field that get inspected and&nbsp;improved. </p>

     <h3><a href="/en/blog/code-in-quarantine/">Code in&nbsp;Quarantine</a></h3> 
     <p>In the current paradigm, we often work with components and have a 1:1 relationship of HTML to CSS. This makes maintenance more predictable. However, it also pronounces the problem of rarely used code—which can be useful to put in&nbsp;quarantine. </p>
