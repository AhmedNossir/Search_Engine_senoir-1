      <p>I create things primarily for you, the web designer/developer who stumbled on this site. If you came here for one thing and are looking for more, you may be interested in the following:</p> 
      <dl> 
       <dt>
        “<a href="http://caniuse.com">Can I use…</a>” browser compatibility tables
       </dt> 
       <dd>
        I couldn’t find an easy to read, comprehensive and interactive way of seeing which browser supported which upcoming feature…so I <a href="http://a.deveria.com/?p=82">made one</a>. Probably the most popular thing I’ve done so far, and indeed intended to be a helpful reference any web designer interested in upcoming features. 
       </dd> 
       <dt>
        <a href="http://svg-edit.googlecode.com">SVG-edit</a> – a vector graphics editor in the browser
       </dt> 
       <dd>
        Not a project that I started, but one that I’ve become heavily involved in, to the point where I became the lead developer. The editor uses HTML5, CSS3 and SVG technologies, pushing the capabilities of modern browsers. Features contributed by me include bezier path editing, the ability to zoom in/out, making the editor extendable together with optional extensions and quite a bit more.

        <a href="http://a.deveria.com/?p=236">CSS Template Layout script</a>
       </dt> 
       <dd>
        The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-layout/">CSS3 Template Layout Module</a> is currently not supported in any browser. A shame, since it’s such a useful mechanism for setting the basic layout of a web page. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/css-template-layout/">This script</a> provides support for the module, so you can <a href="http://a.deveria.com/csstpl/">start practicing</a> to use it now.

        <a href="http://a.deveria.com/?p=205">Rounded corner generator</a>
       </dt>

        Want to use CSS-only rounded corners and include support for Opera? This page will let you enter your corner information and generate the code and an SVG file automatically.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Timeline_of_web_browsers.svg">Timeline of web browsers</a>
       </dt> 
       <dd>
        Inspired by a Linux timeline I saw on Wikipedia and looking for an excuse to try out SVG, I created this Web browser timeline. Seemed like the kind of thing that belonged on Wikipedia, so that’s where I submitted it. Interestingly, it’s currently the main content of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_web_browsers">Timeline of web browsers</a>, which seems fairly unusual for a graphic.

        A small game/app written in 10K of JavaScript for the <a href="http://10k.aneventapart.com/1/">10K Apart</a> contest.

        <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/9231/">eduMap Opera widget</a>

       <dd>
        A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_widget">desktop widget</a> made in SVG for the Opera web browser, it allows users to learn countries and capitals around the world, as well as national flags. The widget has apparently been downloaded over 300,000 times.

        <a href="http://a.deveria.com/?p=34">Operanoid</a>

        A little Arkanoid-like game, initially for the DS web browser, later also available as Opera widget and regular web browsers. Also works for Safari on iPhone/iPod touch

        Not really web related, but there was a contest, you see. Always wanted to try some 3D modelling, and here was my chance.

      <h3>More work</h3> 
      <p>I used to manage the website of the <a href="http://www.newsargus.com">Goldsboro News-Argus</a>, a local newspaper. The current design of the site is mostly my work, but has been heavily affected by decisions and requests of others. </p> 
      <p>Where the visual design may be a bit lacking to my taste, I have been able to focus on the site’s accessibility, and proper use of web standards and semantics. The following techniques are used:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>CSS sprites – to minimize HTTP requests, allowing the site to load faster</li> 
       <li>Unobtrusive JavaScript – To maintain functionality with those without JavaScript, as well as keeping the HTML clean and lean</li> 
       <li>An HTML/CSS design that allows the page content to load before the sidebar(s)</li> 
       <li>8-bit PNGs with alpha transparency to keep image sizes low</li> 
       <li>Pure-CSS drop-down lists – To keep the links accessible</li> 
       <li>Minified JavaScript and CSS files to keep download speed fast</li> 
       <li>CSS visual enhancements where supported</li> 
       <li>JavaScript interaction enhancement (using jQuery) where supported</li> 
       <li>CSS rules for older IE versions kept separate using conditional style sheets</li> 
       <li>A semi-liquid design is used to optimize screen usage and minimize scrolling</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h3>My tools</h3> 
      <p>As mentioned, I love web developing. Mostly coding, sometimes designing. I do all my HTML/CSS writing in a text editor to ensure the code works as best as it can. </p> 
      <p>While I’ve had some experience with Java and Visual Basic, my programming languages of choice are JavaScript and PHP/MySQL. While I’m quite pleased with my JavaScript/DOM knowledge, I usually wind up using jQuery to speed up my JS coding. I used to be a big fan of Adobe Flash, but since learning more about web standards I try to avoid using it. Instead I like experimenting with SVG and HTML5 Canvas, though I could probably get back into Flash pretty easily if I
