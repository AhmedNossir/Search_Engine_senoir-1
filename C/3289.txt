     <p>With more and more software and regulation limiting the data that we pay with for contents and services, we are, in a way, requiring these contents and services to be made truly free. This doesn’t appear sustainable, and the Web is likely to&nbsp;change. </p>

     <h3><a href="/en/blog/people-care/">People&nbsp;Care</a></h3> 
     <p>It seems easy these days to lose faith in people. We’re destroying the planet, elect the least competent and least humane of our peers for presidents, kill our own people when we don’t kill people in other countries, etc.—and yet we all&nbsp;care. </p>

     <p>Love is the essence, love is <em>the</em> emotion. Yet it’s striking how we talk about love, as if there was just one type of love. Aldous Huxley comes to mind, and <cite>After Many a Summer Dies the&nbsp;Swan</cite>. </p>

     <p>For a year now I’ve been toying with the idea of publicly disclosing my salary, as well as my financial assets. Not because of me, but because I’ve come to believe that this step, if taken by others, too, would be a step towards more&nbsp;transparency. </p>
