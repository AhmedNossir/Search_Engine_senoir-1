       <p><strong>“Organization”</strong> means a shared workspace that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User can be a member of more than one Organization.</p>

       <p><strong>"Professional Services Credits"</strong> means the upfront payment method for purchasing Professional Services (exclusive of travel and lodging expenses) that Customer may use over a period of twelve (12) months (unless otherwise stated in an Order Form) for Professional Services.

Customer may only assign one Subscription License per User across its Organizations. For clarity, once Customer assigns a Subscription License to a User, Customer is prohibited from bifurcating the Subscription License so that one User can use a Subscription License on one Organization while another User uses the same Subscription License on another Organization.</p> 
       <p><strong>“Support”</strong> means technical support for the Service that GitHub may provide.</p> 
       <p><strong>"User"</strong> means an individual or Machine Account who (a) accesses or uses the Service, (b) accesses or uses any part of Customer’s account; or (c) directs the use of Customer’s account in the performance of functions, in each case on Customer’s behalf.

       <ul> 
        <li> <p><em>Users.</em> Customer acknowledges that Users retain ultimate administrative control over their individual accounts and the Content within them. <a href="/en/articles/github-terms-of-service">GitHub's Standard Terms of Service</a> govern Users' use of the Service, except with respect to Users' activities under this Section B.</p> </li> 
        <li> <p><em>Organizations.</em> Customer retains ultimate administrative control over any Organization created on Customer’s behalf and User-Generated Content posted to the repositories within its Organization(s), subject to this Section B.

       <p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to Customer's use of GitHub. For example, Customer may be a member of an Organization with its own terms or license agreements; Customer may download an application that integrates with the Service; or Customer may use the Service to authenticate to another service. While this Agreement is GitHub’s full agreement with Customer, other parties' terms govern their relationships with Customer.</p> 
       <h4 id="5-us-federal-government-terms"><a href="#5-us-federal-government-terms">5. U.S. Federal Government Terms</a></h4> 
       <p>If Customer is a U.S. government entity or otherwise accessing or using the Service in a government capacity, the <a href="/en/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users">U.S. Federal Government Amendment</a> applies, and Customer agrees to its provisions.</p>

       <h4 id="1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations"><a href="#1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations">1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer’s use of the Products must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or regulations in its jurisdiction.</p> 
       <h4 id="2-acceptable-use"><a href="#2-acceptable-use">2. Acceptable Use</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer’s use of the Service must comply with <a href="/en/articles/github-acceptable-use-policies">GitHub's Acceptable Use Policies</a> and <a href="/en/articles/github-community-guidelines">GitHub’s Community Guidelines</a>. Customer must not use the Service in any jurisdiction for unlawful, obscene, offensive or fraudulent Content or activity, such as advocating or causing harm, interfering with or violating the integrity or security of a network or system, evading filters, sending unsolicited, abusive, or deceptive messages, viruses or harmful code, or violating third party rights.</p> 
       <h4 id="3-privacy"><a href="#3-privacy">3. Privacy</a></h4> 
       <p>The <a href="/en/articles/github-privacy-statement">GitHub Privacy Statement</a> and the <a href="/en/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-agreement-non-enterprise-customers">GitHub Data Protection Agreement</a> provide detailed notice of GitHub's privacy and data use practices as well as GitHub's processing and security obligations with respect to Customer Personal Data. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from the Service must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of Users' Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If Customer collects any User Personal Information from GitHub, Customer will only use it for the purpose for which the External User has authorized it. Customer will reasonably secure any such Personal Information, and Customer will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or External Users.</p> 
       <h3 id="d-content-responsibility-ownership-license-rights"><a href="#d-content-responsibility-ownership-license-rights">D. Content Responsibility; Ownership; License Rights</a></h3> 
       <h4 id="1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content"><a href="#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content">1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. Customer is solely responsible for any User-Generated Content that it posts, uploads, links to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that User-Generated Content. GitHub is not responsible for any public display or misuse of User-Generated Content.</p> 
       <h4 id="2-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants"><a href="#2-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants">2. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer retains ownership of Customer Content that Customer creates or owns. Customer acknowledges that it: (a) is responsible for Customer Content, (b) will only submit Customer Content that Customer has the right to post (including third party or User-Generated Content), and (c) Customer will fully comply with any third-party licenses relating to Customer Content that Customer posts. Customer grants the rights set forth in Sections D.3 through D.6, free of charge and for the purposes identified in those sections until such time as Customer removes Customer Content from GitHub servers, except for Content Customer has posted publicly and that External Users have Forked, in which case the license is perpetual until such time as all Forks of Customer Content have been removed from GitHub servers. If Customer uploads Customer Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions it needs to run the Service, no additional license is required.</p> 
       <h4 id="3-license-grant-to-us"><a href="#3-license-grant-to-us">3. License Grant to Us</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer grants to GitHub the right to store, archive, parse, and display Customer Content, and make incidental copies, only as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to copy Customer Content to GitHub's database and make backups; display Customer Content to Customer and those to whom Customer chooses to show it; parse Customer Content into a search index or otherwise analyze it on GitHub's servers; share Customer Content with External Users with whom Customer chooses to share it; and perform Customer Content, in case it is something like music or video. These rights apply to both public and Private Repositories. This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Customer Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Customer Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Customer Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Customer Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program. Customer grants to GitHub the rights it needs to use Customer Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Customer Content as necessary to provide the Service.</p> 
       <h4 id="4-license-grant-to-external-users"><a href="#4-license-grant-to-external-users">4. License Grant to External Users</a></h4> 
       <p>Any Content that Customer posts publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to External Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting its repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer agree to allow External Users to view and Fork Customer’s repositories. If Customer sets its pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, Customer grants to External Users a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Customer Content through the Service and to reproduce Customer Content solely on the Service as permitted through functionality provided by GitHub (for example, through Forking). Customer may grant further rights to Customer Content if Customer adopts a license. If Customer is uploading Customer Content that it did not create or own, Customer is responsible for ensuring that the Customer Content it uploads is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to External Users</p> 
       <h4 id="5-contributions-under-repository-license"><a href="#5-contributions-under-repository-license">5. Contributions Under Repository License</a></h4> 
       <p>Whenever Customer adds Content to a repository containing notice of a license, it licenses that Content under the same terms and agrees that it has the right to license that Content under those terms. If Customer has a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.</p> 
       <h4 id="6-moral-rights"><a href="#6-moral-rights">6. Moral Rights</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer retains all moral rights to Customer Content that it uploads, publishes, or submits to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, Customer waives these rights and agrees not to assert them against GitHub, solely to enable GitHub to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D, but not otherwise.</p> 
       <h3 id="e-private-repositories"><a href="#e-private-repositories">E. Private Repositories</a></h3> 
       <h4 id="1-control"><a href="#1-control">1. Control</a></h4> 
       <p>Customer is responsible for managing access to its Private Repositories, including invitations, administrative control of Organizations and teams, and of access.</p> 
       <h4 id="2-confidentiality"><a href="#2-confidentiality">2. Confidentiality</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub considers Customer Content in Customer’s Private Repositories to be Customer’s Confidential Information. GitHub will protect and keep strictly confidential the Customer Content of Private Repositories in accordance with Section P.</p> 
       <h4 id="3-access"><a href="#3-access">3. Access</a></h4> 
       <p>GitHub personnel may only access Customer's Private Repositories in the situations described in our <a href="/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents">Privacy Statement</a>. </p> 
       <p>Customer may choose to enable additional access to its Private Repositories. For example, Customer may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Customer Content in Private Repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat Customer Content in Customer’s Private Repositories as Customer’s Confidential Information. If those services or features require rights in addition to those it needs to provide the Service, GitHub will provide an explanation of those rights.</p> 
       <p>Additionally, we may be <a href="/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure">compelled by law</a> to disclose the contents of your private repositories. </p> 
       <p>GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless <a href="/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure">for legal disclosure</a>, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.</p>

       <p>Some Service features may be subject to additional terms as set forth in the <a href="/en/github/site-policy/github-additional-product-terms">GitHub Additional Product Terms</a>. By accessing or using these features, Customer agrees to the GitHub Additional Product Terms.</p>

       <p>Subscription Licenses are granted on a per User basis and multiple Users may not use the same Subscription License. Customer may reassign a Subscription License to a new User only after ninety (90) days from the last reassignment of that same Subscription License, unless the reassignment is due to (i) permanent hardware failure or loss, (ii) termination of the User’s employment or contract, or (iii) temporary reallocation of Subscription Licenses to cover a User’s absence. When Customer reassigns a Subscription License from one User to another, Customer must block the former User’s access to the Subscription License and Customer’s Organizations.</p> 
       <h3 id="i-affiliates"><a href="#i-affiliates">I. Affiliates</a></h3>

Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If Customer fails to pay any Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.</p> 
       <p><strong>Usage-Based Billing</strong> Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge.

Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears, provided that for invoiced customers, paid Service features are billed in advance.

Customer is responsible for ensuring that its purchase order issued to GitHub for the Professional Services reflects the pricing set forth in the SOW. If there is any difference in pricing listed in the SOW and the pricing listed in Customer’s purchase order, the pricing in the SOW will control. The Parties agree that SOWs payable via Professional Services Credits do not have to be signed by either Party to be valid and enforceable.
